# rexpack-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate with react, express and webpack and react-bootstrap for design stuff. 
It offers a dev and prod server as well as dev and prod builds and js/css hot reloading for the dev build. 
The prod build is uglified and minified.

Routing is handled by react-router-dom for now.
